# NC NEWS APP

This is the front end I have created as part of Northcoders Coding Bootcamp.

The purpose of the project was to create an interface that allows the user to interact with the API I created earlier on the course.

The app allows the user to:

- view a list of all the articles stored in the API.
- click on an article to read the full contents.
- the user can sort the articles by author, date written,
- votes or topic in either ascending or descending order.
- view a page of articles on a single topic, which would also
- allow the user to share a URL.
- comment on an article and delete other comments they have - previously made
- Up vote or Down vote an article (limited to one press until refreshed)

The app was created in React and written in Vscode. The whole project was managed using Trello.
