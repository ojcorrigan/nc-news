# NC NEWS APP

This is the front end I have created as part of Northcoders Coding Bootcamp.

The purpose of the project was to create an interface that allows the user to interact with the API I created earlier on the course.

The app allows the user to:

- view a list of all the articles stored in the API.
- click on an article to read the full contents.
- the user can sort the articles by author, date written,
- votes or topic in either ascending or descending order.
- view a page of articles on a single topic, which would also
- allow the user to share a URL.
- comment on an article and delete other comments they have - previously made
- Up vote or Down vote an article (limited to one press until refreshed)

The app was created in React and written in Vscode. The whole project was managed using Trello.

## Step by step.

To get the app running first fork and clone the repo to your own github. Click the fork button and select where you would like to copy the repo to.

Once you have done this copy the link from github. To clone to your local machine navigate to the folder you wish to clone it to and type into the commandline:

`git clone <YOUR URL HERE>`

once you have cloned the repo you will need to install the dependencies. in the command line type:

`npm i`

you should have the following listed in your package.json:

- axios
- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom

once all the dependencies are installed you will just need to is run

`npm start`

you should now have the app up and running in your browser.
